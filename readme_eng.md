Results of the Ukrainian presidential elections in 2014
---------------------------------------------------

This interactive application allows anyone to explore the features of past elections of the President of Ukraine.
I have developd severalinteresting materials those you can study in detail:

1. Scatterplot that shows coordinates of all polling stations.
2. Histogram of results for each of the candidates and comparative histograms.
3. Scatterplot that shows relationship between results of candidates, turnout, etc.
4. Generalized by county data in tabular form.

If you want to explore the features of the voting process you can use special filters. You can limit results by selecting polling stations by their size, time of submission of result protocols and the polling station location.

I would be grateful for your comments, feedback and suggestions.
